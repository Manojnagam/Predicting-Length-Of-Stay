# Predicting-Length-Of-Stay
**Description** :  
This project utilized a data-driven approach to predict patient LOS in hospitals. The analysis included diverse datasets comprising patient demographics, clinical indicators, and vital signs. Various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LGBMRegressor, were employed to uncover the factors influencing LOS. The implementation culminated in using the XGBoost algorithm for its superior predictive performance.

**The project involved**:  
 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing : Ensuring data quality through cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.  
 Feature Engineering : Identifying key determinants influencing LOS through statistical and machine learning methods.  
 Model Development: Training, testing, and fine-tuning multiple models to achieve high predictive accuracy.  
 Model Evaluation : Ensured reliability and generalizability using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.  
 Interpretability : Leveraged SHAP values to provide actionable insights into LOS determinants for stakeholders.

**Key Achievements**:  
 Improved prediction accuracy by 15% over baseline models.  
 Streamlined hospital operations by enabling data-backed decisions for bed management and resource allocation.  
 Highlighted cost-saving opportunities through better patient flow management.  

**Tools and Technologies Used**:  
 Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Outcome**:  
 The project delivered actionable insights into patient care workflows and resource utilization, fostering improved decision-making in healthcare delivery systems.
